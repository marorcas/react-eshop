        description: 'The all new Satori traditional recurve by Hoyt epitomises their long, rich history of innovation, cutting edge technology and classic design. In designing this bow, Hoyt engineers made sure the Satori was the perfect blend of both traditional and modern technology. Satori comes in various lengths and configurations to perfectly fit each archer. The Satori utilises the Original Earl Hoyt dovetail system, featuring micro adjustment for precise limb alignment and includes an innovative, adjustable shelf module which features centre shot alignment plate that allows the archer to fine tune their centre shot while maintaining the simplicity of shooting off the shelf. The shelf module can also be removed for shooting, allowing archers to utilise a standard flipper style rest.',
